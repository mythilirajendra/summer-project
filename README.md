# summer-project
phone monitored security system:

In this project, I'm going to use IR and ultrasonic sensors to detect movement(obstacle). These sensors will be placed outside every door, window or any possible entrance.
The data from the sensors will be stored and retrived through "ThingSpeak.com". An app will be created('MIT Appinventor') through which commands can be sent by the user through
his phone. Actuators can be controlled hrough this app. If there's someone unexpected at the door(or window) and we're not at home, we can make the alarm buzzer ring by 
controlling via the app.

Timeline:

6th May-12th May: learn about MQTT and other protocols.
13th May-25th May: learn other IoT related stuff
26th May-1st June: figure out how exactly i'm going to do my project(everything from hardware connections to code)
2nd June-15th June: start building my project and finish it.
16th June-10th July: if there's something wrong, and it does'nt work as expected, fix and debug all the issues.
